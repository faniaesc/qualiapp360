# QualiApp360

The main objective of this project was the development of an app that could gather different video quality assesment metrics for omnidirectional videos. 

Through loading a reference video and an impaired version of the same video, this app compares them to calculate and obtain comparative data about the image quality.

Metrics included:
* PSNR
* SSIM
* M-SSIM
* VMAF 360º
* S-PSNR
* WS-PSNR

# Documentation

For a preview of the app execution, here is the video demo of the app [In Spanish]:
